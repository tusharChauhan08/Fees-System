# Fees-System
In this poject we have four files and there is three modules.
In first file account.py in which create the account of the Admin.
In second file which is student.py in which we add the student details and we update the student details and we delete student details.
In third file which is feeSystem.py in which we create the fees slip for the student and add the paid amount of the fees which is paid by the student.
So this project basically that create the account of the Admin which is submit the fees and add the student detials and also view that how much fees is pending of which particular student.
This project is completely base on the python and we use the MySQL for the database to maintaining all the detials and we also build this program on the OOPs of python.
